```
git clone git@github.com:FerdyJumah/testproject.git
```

after making changes we run the following three commands.
```
git add .
```
this command tells git to recognize any changes in this folder.
```
git commit -m "i have added a new function"
```
this command describes the changes we've made.
```
git push origin main
```
this command pushes our code to github respository (origin) to the main branch
